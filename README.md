image processing library for pulling optimized assets from Cloudinary

TODO:

- See /js/stormfront.js for the full list of current todos

## Getting started

Required:

The distributable version of the plugin can be built with [buildify](https://github.com/powmedia/buildify) to install it run:

`npm i buildify`

You can make changes to the build.js file in the project and run `node build.js` to generate the production use JavaScript plugin.

If you would like to see the example page served locally, install `serve` and then run serve from the root folder.

```bash
npm i serve
# after the install completes, run
serve
```

## Support

You can turn in an issue on GitHub, and any PRs that you think would make this better. Please note that this is an open project, but will be geared heavily for internal corporate use, so some changes may be declined.
